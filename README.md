This project is a quiz application ran by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code was written from scratch and resembles a baseball trivia game. The HTML is written with correct semantics and the CSS is properly formatted. This trivia game is meant for anyone to play but is especially fun for those that enjoy the sport of baseball. To begin, the user presses the "play" button.

After pressing "play" the user is prompted with questions as well as a timer that begins. The timer reduces as incorrect answers are inputted and the quiz ends when the timer reaches 0.
